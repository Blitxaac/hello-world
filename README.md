# hello-world
`Greetings fellow human. 'Twas the 4th of September, 2025. It is a wonderful day. TI is starting soon and Silksong will be released today.`  

## Introduction
Coding really isn't my thing, but I keep bumping into it. Hence, I decided it's about time I dabbled a bit more in it. :globe_with_meridians: CIV 6 has turned me into a zombie who just wants to make more trade routes. Say it with me: **GILGABRO**

## Some Math
$\alpha\cdot M + \beta = \gamma$  
Yeah, I know a little $\LaTeX{}$. What's that? Behold:

# $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2{\phi} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial{}t}\phi$
